    In research for design I made a research of a subculture. I chose photography as my research field. First of all, I did desk researching about photography. I found out that making living as a photographer is pretty hard nowadays due to the fact that today’s world everybody has a camera in their pocket. <br>
After the desk research, I prepared questions for an interview that I made with one of the photography students from The Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. Mostly I concentrated on finding out the motives why somebody studies photography in an art university.<br>
The thing that motivates a photography student to study in an art school is that then the student can express themselves through photography.<br>
<br>

An example from my research
<br>
Theme 3:<br>
studying photography
 <br>
Description
By studying photography, I mean how does someone see studying photography in school.
 Data <br>
Her: In the Art School, we have a lot of studios and I haven’t been shooting in the studio before. (So, it gives her more experimenting opportunities).
Data from desk research. <br>
From an article called “Why study photography?”. Nowadays as we all know photography has become to a point that to live off purely from photography is really hard and the change to succeed is low. The reason why people study photography is to have a way to express their feelings and emotions and thoughts. And one interesting quote from the article “When you enter the world of professional photography as a photographer, it is your work and how you present that work — not a certificate or grade — that speaks for you”. <br>

Nowadays it’s not that much about the photography as an job but more as an way to communicate with other people. The photography language so do say is the universal language.  <br>
<br>
Also from the interview I found out how people are expressing their emotions trough photography.
 <br>
 Theme 1: Expressing your emotions via photography.
Description
As an art form, some people like to express themselves via art like for example photography
 Data
Her: I had a dramatizing experience in my childhood It was a dramatizing experience. And Photography was a way to express my emotions and to show how I was feeling. I am not good with words so it was a good way to tell my parents how ages I was about it and how depressed I was. Then eventually it transformed into more like photography.
<br>
I also observed how photographers study photography.
