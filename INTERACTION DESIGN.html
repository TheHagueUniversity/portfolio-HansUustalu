      Here are some examples from my experience with interaction design

  <a class="title20" id="liig"> Expert review</a>
  <p id="text"  class="blog">

  Here is an expert review that I made about a store "The Dutch Store". In the review, I categorized differently the main points that I kept attention on while I was reviewing the website. As I was scanning through the website I picked up the parts on the website that fitted into the categories of the expert review. When I found an issue on the website that fitted into the category I made a screenshot of it and wrote what was the issue with this particular item was. The expert review was useful for the next step as I started to make a prototype of the new re-design of the webpage that can be seen below.

  <a class="title20" id="liig"> Prototype</a>
  <p id="text"  class="blog">
  Here are the screenshots of the prototype. The prototype is based on the expert review and the analysis of the website "The Dutch Store". The main goal was to make the navigation on the website more graspable and easily understandable. The important point that I changed was the way the store items were presented. On the website, the items were presented in a list of items. Unfortunately in that way, the images of the product didn't have that much of an appearance. The change that I made was that I used the grid system to present the items with bigger images and with the title of the product under the image. As I made the image bigger and more presentable I also changed the way the items description was presented. One of the crucial changes that I also did was the way the log-in screen was appears to the user.
