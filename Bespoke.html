    In this course in my studies, I had a design partner with whom I designed a personalized gift receiving experience. So, in the project me and my design partner had two users one for each. For that we both had to conduct an interview with the same topics. To get similar information but from two different user perspective.<br>


    The first part of putting the plan together and make the topic for an interview with the user.  After that me and my design partner had to conduct the interview. Unfortunately, then some issues accorded. For example, my user didn’t show up on time where we had arranged the meeting. So, then whole process just got stack for some time. But we managed to deliver everything on time in the end.<br>
    When me and my design partner got enough information then we made our own portrait about our user. This phase helped me to empathise with the user because then I processed the data trough.

    From the portrait, we analysed both of our portraits of the user and then started to create a combined persona. The persona consisted of the similarities from both of the users.<br>

    The persona give us a very good over view of the important parts of the whole data. So, it helped to create and Design vison for creating the design of the experience. Also, it helped us to define the aspects that on what we should focused on in this particular project. As it came from the analysed data that our users combined together is lacing of time management skills. From that we decided to create and design an “Time Management Game”. I created a tool for a user who is going to create the gift for someone. After analysing the data and made the designe vison then I created a prototype of the toll which is met for a user who is the giver in this senario.<br><br>

    Here are the screen shots of the prototype that I made.
