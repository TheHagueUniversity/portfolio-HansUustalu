    <a class="title5">What did I learn from the project?</a>
    <p id="text"  class="blog">
      From the project, I learned how to make a time table for the project. When some parts of the project have to be done. As it was a pear work. So as I was the planner for the team then I learned how no make a clear point about what we have to do. Also, I learned what to do and how to reschedule the plan if, for example, the user that I had to make an interview with didn't show up on time. <br> From the design part I learned how to design a prototype webpage in Adobe XD which was very helpful for improving prototyping skills.

    <a class="title5">My Bespoke Design Project</a>
    <p id="text"  class="blog">
      The goal of my project was to create an unwrapping experience and create a tool for a giver.<br>
      According to the project scheme we did it in pairs. Every pair get two persons as users who were selected by the lecturers. Our first task was to get to know our users by interviewing them. In forehand we agreed on topics to be covered in the interviews, as I interviewed one of the users and my partner the other. Based on the interviews we created our user portraits separately.<img src="images/IMG_12.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="595.5" align="left"> The portrait reflected the most important and helpful insights from the interview. Beside the portrait both of us made an individual design vision, for processing the important information from the interview and also from the desk research. After me and my design partner had done the individual part, we made a fictional persona combined from the two different user portraits.<img src="images/Picture1.png" alt="" width="432" height="603.5" align="right" class="text_pic"> The fictional persona had personal characteristics from both users. We picked three most important aspects from the fictional persona, which was now the user for us and concentrated on these, while we were also built up the team design vision. The vision included a tool description how the tool will be going to look like. Also, the design vision consisted of the description of how the unwrapping experience is going to be. After the design vision, we created a paper prototype of the tool and made a paper prototype of the unwrapping experience. The experience part was made as a story where you could click on the paper buttons and then you can move on to the next phase. After the paper prototype, we made a digital prototype of both parts. The digital prototype was the final outcome of that project. I made the digital prototype of the tool. Images of the tool are below.
