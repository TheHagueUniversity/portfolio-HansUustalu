      Dear visitor!
      <br>
      <br>
      My name is Hans Uustalu.



      I am  UX design student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The interest to go and study UX design came from the perspective that I have been a photographer for 10 years. Also, the fact that I am a visual person but on the other hand I am not into so much of drawing. As I am a visual person  I am always being thinking of creating something for the web.  So  at one point I was looking for a web design studies but most of them where taught in master courses.  I had to find something else that would suit for me.<br> <br>I happened to find out about  UXD (User Experience Design).

      UXD  engaged me because of the user centred design. Here the user comes first. Studying UX design I have understood that the field is very wide in a sense that it has a lot of different parts and aspects that you can focus on. Such as Experience Strategy, User Research, Information Architecture, Interaction Design. While all parts are important, I find Interaction Design most intriguing.  My aim is to prototype products as user friendly as possible and make the experience  enjoyable.

      <br><br>Also, a bit about my background. I am from Estonia and I am 21 years old.As mentioned above, one of my greatest hobbies is photography. This gives me the opportunity to express myself through visual language.
