      Hello, dear visitor!
      <br>
      <br>
      My name is Hans Uustalu.
      <br>
      I am a UX design student in The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The interest to go and study UX design came from the perspective that I am also a photographer for 10 years. Also, the fact that I am a visual person but on the other hand I am not into so much of drawing. As I am a visual person then I am always being thinking of creating something for the web like websites.  So Then at one point I was looking for a web design studies but most of them where taught in master courses. So, I had to find something else that will suit for me. Then I happened to find out about a field called UXD (User Experience Design).<br>
      UXD field engaged me because of the user centred design. So, the user comes first. Studying UX design it has given me the feeling that the field is very wide in a sense that it contains a lot of different parts and aspects that you can focus on. As you can focus on different fields like Experience strategy, User Research, Information architecture, Interaction Design. I personally focus more on to the Interaction Design part. Where for example I can focus on the user interaction with specific things on a website and how users interact with it. So, I could make the experience better for the user.<br>
      Also, a bit about my back ground. I am from Estonia and I am 21 years old. One of my great hobby is photography. I have been a photographer for over 10 years. This gives me the opportunity to express myself through visual language. So, I have been also working as a photographer since twelfth grade besides school back in my home country Estonia.
